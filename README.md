# Hack-Free Layouts with CSS Grid #
Code and slides for my "Hack-Free Layouts with CSS Grid" presentation.

**Using this solution**

This project has various files that incrementally build on what CSS Grid has to offer. Before you begin, run `npm install` to load all the dependencies. Then, run `npm start`. You should be able to make your changes, which will refresh the page whenever you make a save in your editor of choice.

**Abstract**

The only things certain in life are death, taxes, and hacking your way through a CSS layout -- until now. Come for a deep dive on CSS Grid, a framework-free, library-free, layout system that is orchestrated for designing today's modern web applications. After an hour, you'll come away rejuvenated that you don't have to hack layouts any longer - and enjoy designing responsive layouts using only the CSS specification.
