# Hack-Free Layouts with CSS Grid
Code and slides for my "Hack-Free Layouts with CSS Grid" presentation.

**Abstract**

The only things certain in life are death, taxes, and hacking your way through a CSS layout -- until now. Come for a deep dive on CSS Grid, a framework-free, library-free, layout system that is orchestrated for designing today's modern web applications. After an hour, you'll come away rejuvenated that you don't have to hack layouts any longer - and enjoy designing responsive layouts using only the CSS specification.
